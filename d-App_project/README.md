In the World Blockchain Hackathon conducted in Vaagdevi college, Warangal, we came up with an idea to secure vehicle eco-system.

For this, we have prepared a chart and ppt to demonstrate our idea in the Hackathon and we have developed simple prototype of our idea.

We implemented Dapp popularly known as Decentralized application.

Dapp is the application where we can similarize with website. But the backend of the websites we are using now is purely centralized.
That means these websites are using centrally powered databases and servers.
The problem with centralization is that the powers of admin might be misused and data can be tampered by hackers.
Hence, in Dapp the backend used is Blockchain.

Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed platform which maintain permanent immutable record.
There are many popular Blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Hyperledger.
We have done this Dapp using Ethereum Blockchain.
We have used Solidity programming language, truffle, ganache-cli, node, react and other frameworks, tools and technologies.
